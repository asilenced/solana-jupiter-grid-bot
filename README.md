# Solana Jupiter Grid Bot

----------- Only Works With SOL-USDC -----------
----- Please Ensure You Have USDC Balance! -----

NodeJS and NPM required

Run the install.bat file to create the .env file for you, and run the npm install command, to download all extra necessary packages. 

In the new .env file, simply paste you Solana Wallet Keypair, and your RPC Endpoint address. (Tested with Phantom, but any base58 keypair should work).

Then, node gridbot.js to run!
