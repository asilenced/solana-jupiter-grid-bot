# Solana Jupiter Grid Bot

Run at your own risk! I am not liable for any losses using this script!

Please ensure you have the correct token already available in your wallet. Auto-50/50 balancing will come later, as well as full auto setup.

NodeJS and NPM required

Run the install.bat file to create the .env file for you, and run the npm install command, to download all extra necessary packages. 

In the new .env file, simply paste you Solana Wallet Keypair, and your RPC Endpoint address. (Tested with Phantom, but any base58 keypair should work).

Then, node gridbot.js to run!
